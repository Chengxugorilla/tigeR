# Getting Started with tigeR{-}

## Introuction

tigeR encompasses three distinct yet closely interconnected modules. The Biomarker Evaluation module enables researchers to evaluate whether the biomarkers of interest are associated with immunotherapy response via built-in or custom immunotherapy gene expression data. The Tumor Microenvironment Deconvolution module integrates 10 open-source algorithms to obtain the proportions of different cell types within the tumor microenvironment, facilitating the investigation of the association between immune cell populations and immunotherapy response. The Prediction Model Construction module equips users with the ability to construct sophisticated prediction models using a range of built-in machine learning algorithms. By providing these diverse functionalities, tigeR aims to simplify the process of analyzing immunotherapy gene expression data, thus making it accessible to researchers without advanced programming skills.

## Installation

```r
packages <- c("BiocManager", "devtools")
for (package in packages) {
  if (!require(package, character.only = TRUE)) {
    install.packages(package)
  }
}
devtools::install_github("YuLab-SMU/tigeR")
```
