# 1 Signature Discovery
## 1.1 Gini_rank()
By calculating the Gini index of different genes, you can get an overview of the classification efficiency of different genes.
```
Gini_rank(MEL_GSE78220)
```
## 1.2 diff_gene()
Return differential expression genes.
```
diff_gene(MEL_GSE78220)
```


# 2 Response Prediction
## 2.1 Predict Response using existing Signatures
You can get a overall Signature score matrix of 23 Signatures in tigeR using predict_Signature() function
```
result <- predict_Signature(extract_mtr('MEL_GSE78220'))
```
## 2.2 Predict Response using built-in functions in tigeR
You can use functions build_NB_model, build_SVM_model, build_RF_model, build_CC_model, build_Adaboost_model, build_Logitboost_model, build_Logistics_model to build corresponding machine learning predictive models (naive Bayes models, Support vector machine model, random forest model, Cancerclass model, Adaboost model, Logitboost model, Logistics regression model). 

parameter SE input to the function is the SummarizedExperiment object in R or a list of Summarized Experiment objects (including expression profile information and patient clinical information)

parameter Signature is a subset of the genes you are interested in

parameter rmBE if TRUE, it means that the function needs to remove the batch effect between datasets through the built-in Batch Effect Removal Tool Combat

Parameter response_NR if TRUE, it means that the function is required to automatically convert the patient's drug response (such as PR, NR, SD, etc. to NR (non-responder) or R (Responder))


The function returns a trained model, after which the user can enter the patient's bulk RNA sequencing expression profile, and the model returns the patient's predicted label.

# 3 Tumor Microenviroment Deconvolution
## 3.1 CIBERSORT()
CIBERSORT is an analytical tool from the Alizadeh Lab and Newman Lab to impute gene expression profiles and provide an estimation of the abundances of member cell types in a mixed cell population, using gene expression data.

tigeR offer you an built-in function CIBERSORT() for estimation of the abundances of member cell types.
```
CIBERSORT(sig_matrix = LM22, mix_matrix = extract_mtr('MEL_GSE78220'), perm = 0, QN = TRUE)
```
parameter sig_matrix is a expression matrix of Signature genes from each type of immune cells
  LM22 is a matrix which contain expression of Signature genes of each type of immune cell

parameter mix_matrix is the expression matrix of bulk RNA-seq which you want to know its cell fraction

parameter perm is the number of permutations

parameter QN perform quantile normalization or not (TRUE/FALSE)

CIBERSORT function will return a list which first element is the cell type proportion matrix and second element is a boxplot.


# 4 Immunotherapy Response
## 4.1 Immunotherapy_Response()
```{r}
Immunotherapy_Response(gene = 'CD274',SE = MEL_GSE78220)
```
parameter gene is the gene which you wanted.
parameter SE is an SummarizedExperiment(SE) object or a list consists of SE objects. The colData of SE objects must contain treatment information names Treatment.

Immunotherapy_Response() perform differential expression analysis and survival analysis in certain gene and return the result.

The score of differential expression analysis is calculated by −𝑆𝐼𝐺𝑁(𝑙𝑜𝑔2(𝐹𝐶)) × 𝑙𝑜𝑔10(𝑃), where 𝐹𝐶 represents the fold change and 𝑃 represents the P value derived from the Wilcoxon rank-sum test

The score of survival analysis is calculated by −𝑆𝐼𝐺𝑁(𝑙𝑜𝑔2(𝐻𝑅)) × 𝑙𝑜𝑔10(𝑃), where 𝐻𝑅 represents the hazard ratio and 𝑃 represents the P value derived from univariate Cox regression analysis.

## 4.2 Visualization
### 4.2.1 plt_diff()

plot differential analysis result between Pre-Treatment and Post-Treatment patients
```{r}
plt_diff(gene = 'CD274', SE = MEL_GSE78220, type = 'Treatment') 
```

plot differential analysis result between Responders and Non-Responders
```{r}
plt_diff(gene = 'CD274', SE = MEL_GSE78220, type = 'Response')
```

### 4.2.2 plt_surv()
plot survival analysis result
```{r}
plt_surv(gene = 'CD274', SE = MEL_GSE78220)
```
