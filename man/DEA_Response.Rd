\title{Calculating differential expression score between responder and non_responder.}
\usage{
DEA_Response(Score, meta, PT_drop)
}
\arguments{
\item{Score}{an SummarizedExperiment(SE) object or a list consists of SE objects. The colData of SE objects must contain response information names response.}

\item{meta}{The geneSet which you wanted.}

\item{PT_drop}{If TRUE, only Untreated patient will be use for model training.}
}
\description{
Differential expression score was alculated using the following formula: −𝑆𝐼𝐺𝑁(𝑙𝑜𝑔2(𝐹𝐶)) × 𝑙𝑜𝑔10(𝑃), where 𝐹𝐶 represents the fold change and 𝑃 represents the P value derived from the Wilcoxon rank-sum test
