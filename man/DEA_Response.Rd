DEA_Response(SE, gene)
}

\item{SE}{an SummarizedExperiment(SE) object or a list consists of SE objects. The colData of SE objects must contain response information names response.}

\item{gene}{The gene which you wanted.}

\description{
Differential expression score was alculated using the following formula: −𝑆𝐼𝐺𝑁(𝑙𝑜𝑔2(𝐹𝐶)) × 𝑙𝑜𝑔10(𝑃), where 𝐹𝐶 represents the fold change and 𝑃 represents the P value derived from the Wilcoxon rank-sum test
