The column names of the table represent the clinical information of patients. The detailed information about the column names is presented below. table { width: 100%; border-collapse: collapse; /* 边框将被合并为单一边框 */ } th, td { border-bottom: 1px solid #ccc; /* 设置底部边框 */ text-align: center; padding: 8px; /* 单元格内边距 */ } th { border-top: 1px solid #ccc; /* 设置顶部边框 */ } column name Recommend value Description Necessity in tigeR analysis sample id character The sample identification. ✕ patient_name character The patient identification. ✕ dataset_id character The dataset identification. ✕ dataset_group character ✕ Treatment PRE/POST The patient sample is collected after Treatment or before Treatment ✓ response CR/MR/PR/PD/SD/NR/R/N The Immunotherapy response. ✕ response_NR R/N The Immunotherapy response which only contains R or N. ✓ M.stage character The M stage of patients. ✕ overall.survival..days. value The number of days, months or years of survival time of patients.(all samples must be the same unit) ✓ vital.status Alive/Dead The survival status of patient. ✓ Total.Mutation numeric The total mutation gene numbers. ✕ Gender M/F The gender of patient. ✕ Therapy character The anti-tumor therapy on patients. ✕ age_start numeric When the tumor is diagnosed. ✕ tumor_type character The type of tumor. ✕ seq_type character The sequencing type. ✕ id character The identification of dataset. ✕ 2.2 Obtain data from tigeR web server Dataloader(c(1,2,3), use_source=&quot;Web Server&quot;) 2.3 Obtain data from ExperimentHub Dataloader(c(1,2,3), use_source=&quot;ExperimentHub) "],["404.html", "Page not found", " Page not found The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed).
