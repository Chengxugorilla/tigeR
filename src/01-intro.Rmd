## Organization of built-in data
The built-in data follows several specifications for constructing: 
  
â‘  They are constructed into a SummarizedExperiment object using the **SummarizedExperiment()** function in SummarizedExperiment package.  
  
â‘¡ The assays of the SummarizedExperiment object are stored as a SimpleList containing an expression matrix, where rows represent genes and columns represent patients. 
  
â‘¢ The colData of the SummarizedExperiment object is a table(DFrame object of S4), where the row names must be the same as the column names of the expression matrix. The column names of the table represent the clinical information of patients. The detailed information about the column names is presented below.

## Obtain data from tigeR web server
```
Dataloader(c(1,2,3), use_source="Web Server")
```
## Obtain data from ExperimentHub
```
Dataloader(c(1,2,3), use_source="ExperimentHub)
```
## Pre-processing of Custom Data
â€ƒWhen importing custom data, you need to prepare at least one expression matrix (rows for genes, columns for samples), along with the corresponding column information table, which should include at least the following information:

- sample id
- Treatment (PRE/POST)
- response_NR (R/N)
- overall.survival..days. (Missing data is also acceptable)
- vital.status (Missing data is also acceptable)

â€ƒHere is a brief example:

<div style="width:780px; height:300px; overflow-y: scroll; overflow-x: hidden;">
```
## Construt FPKM Matrix
genes <- c("5S_rRNA", "A1BG", "A1BG-AS1")
samples <- c("SRR3184279", "SRR3184280", "SRR3184281")

mtr <- matrix(
  c(0.04115157, 0.01311394, 0.02275499,
    0.07774626, 0.29494916, 0.11743900,
    2.01782650, 0.83763027, 0.77378394),
  nrow = 3, ncol = 3, byrow = TRUE, 
  dimnames = list(genes, samples))

## Construct Clinical Information Table
data <- data.frame(
  sample_id = c("SRR3184279", "SRR3184280", "SRR3184281"),
  Treatment = c("PRE", "PRE", "PRE"),
  response_NR = c("N", "R", "R"),
  overall_survival_days = c(607, 927, 948),
  vital_status = c("Dead", "Alive", "Alive"),
  stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

## Construct SummarizedExperiment Object
SE <- SummarizedExperiment::SummarizedExperiment(
  assays = list(fpkm = mtr),
  colData = data)

SE
# class: SummarizedExperiment
# dim: 3 3
# metadata(0):
#   assays(1): fpkm
# rownames(3): 5S_rRNA A1BG A1BG-AS1
# rowData names(0):
#   colnames(3): SRR3184279 SRR3184280 SRR3184281
# colData names(5): sample_id Treatment response_NR overall_survival_days
# vital_status
